Bhaskara Calculator in C

# Introduction

This project consists of developing a Bhaskara calculator using the C language. The main objective was to improve skills in structured programming, variable manipulation and application of mathematical concepts.

## Motivation

The decision to develop a Bhaskara calculator came from the desire to practice fundamental C concepts, such as data input and output, flow control and manipulation of mathematical functions, in addition to reinforcing the understanding of Bhaskara's formula.

Learnings

During the development of this project, several important pieces of knowledge were acquired, including:

# 1. Manipulation of Variables and Data Types

Use of float and double variables to represent coefficients and results.

Understanding numerical precision and its impact on the final result.

# 2. Data Input and Output

Use of scanf and printf to obtain and display input and output values.

Handling invalid inputs to ensure the robustness of the program.

# 3. Programming Logic

Implementation of Bhaskara's formula to find real roots.

Handling special cases, such as negative delta (no real roots) and delta equal to zero (single root).

# 4. Conditional Structures

Using conditional structures (if, else if, else) to check the value of delta.

Ensuring that the program behaves correctly in different scenarios.

# 5. Code Organization

Efforts to keep the code clean, commented and modular.

Separation of functions for calculations and display of results.

Challenges Encountered

Ensuring the accuracy of calculations in cases of very small or very large values.

Handling invalid inputs and avoiding program crashes.

Implementing a clear and easy-to-understand logical flow.

## Conclusion

Developing this Bhaskara calculator provided a better understanding of the fundamentals of the C language and the development of mathematical programs. It was possible to reinforce skills in variable manipulation, flow control and good programming practices.

This project serves as a basis for future more complex work and highlights the importance of organization, readability and robustness of the code.
